# Eloquent and Queries

- I want you to think critically and analyze the prompt thoroughly before providing any solution
- Keep this in mind. You need to provide queries that are performant for retrieval, insertion, update, and deletion of data.
- Limit the number of solutions to maximum of 1. It should be the most performant and recommended solution possible. Make sure it is also not overly complicated.
